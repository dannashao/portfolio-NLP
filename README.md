# Demonstration code portfolio on Natural language processing (NLP)

This repository contains notebooks demonstrating how to deal with the following NLP tasks:

* Named Entity Recognition (NER)
  - (cuML) Building SVM with dense word embeddings accelerated by GPU
  - (Keras) Building LSTM with dense word embeddings and concatenation with categorical features
  - (sklearn) Result analysis
* Negation Scope Detection (NEG)
  - (huggingface) Create huggingface.Dataset and evaluation.metric
  - (transformers) Fine-tuning BERT for negation scope detection
  - (spaCy) Traditional feature engineering approaches
  - Visualization for error analysis
* Semantic Role Labeling (SRL)
  - (transformers) Two different models on fine-tuning BERT for SRL
 
See details in the notebooks.
